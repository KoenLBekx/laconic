LACONIC

	Language characteristics

		General syntax

			The laconic language is Polish expression interpreter :

				*+4 2 3

			evaluates to 18.

			A laconic expression consist of atoms that can either be
			- operators
			- numbers
			- string bracket contents
			- comment bracket contents

			All atoms are case-sensitive.

			If there are more atoms than expected by the preceding operators,
			the preceding results are discarded and the value of the remaining expression is returned.

			E.g.:

				*+4 2 3 25

			will return 25, just like

				*+4 2 3 + 19 6

		Operators

			All operators consist of a single character that precedes its operands.

			See below for a detail explanation of each operator.

			There's never a need to separate an operator from preceding or following atoms using a whitespace,
			but it's permitted for readability.

			Note: the characters " and ' are nowhere used in Laconic, as they interfere with Linux command line syntax.

		Numbers

			Numbers consist of characters 0 up to 9, and may contain exactly one period as fractal separator. (Unary minus, ~, is an operator.)
			If the number is between 1 and -1 exclusive, the period may be the first character of the number.
			For readability, underscores _ may be inserted anywhere in a number :
			(In fact, prior to the interpretion of a formula, all underscores are discarded from it.)

			Eg.:
				.000_001 = 0.000001
				1_000_000 = 1000000

			A number is allowed to end with a period :

				40. = 40

			And a sole period is interpreted as zero :

				. = 0

			Note that a second period in a number is considered to be the start of the repeating part of a number:

				12.3.8 is interpreted as 12.3888...

				so

				12.3.9 yields 12.4

				(See 
					Su, Francis E., et al. “Why Does 0.999… = 1?.” Math Fun Facts
					https://math.hmc.edu/funfacts/why-does-0-999-1/
				)

			A third period in a number is interpreted as the start of a new number between 1 and ~1 exclusively:

				+1.0.0.2

				is interpreted as

				+1 .2
				
				and yields

				1.2

		String brackets content

			Strings are enclosed between [s and ]

			Eg.:

				[sKunji Namparshespa] yields the string "Kunji Namparshespa".

			For numerical operations, the Laconic interpreter obtains the numeric value of a string
			by simply treating it as a Laconic expression itself.
			Thereby, characters that are no operators are ignored and treated as separators.

		Comment brackets content

			Comments are enclosed between [c and ]

			Eg.:

				$20 100[c Let's populate variable 20 with 100.]v20[c This entire expression should yield 100.]


		Whitespace

			Whitespace (any number of blanks, tabs, CR, LF) is treated as atom separator.

			As operators consist of only one character, they don't need to be separated by whitespace from anything else; two consecutive numbers, however, do.

	Operators

		Basic arithmetic

			~ Unary minus

				+1~4 yields ~3
				-1~4 yields 5

			+ Addition of next two operands

				+5 6 yields 11

			- Subtraction

				-6 5 yields 1

			* Multiplication

				* 38 ~5 yields ~190

			^ Power (exponent)

				^ 2 .5 yields 1.4142...

			% Modulo (Remainder)

				%7 3 yields 1
				%7.1 3.1 yields .9

		Variables

			$ Variable assignment

				Variables are designated by any number, including negative and non-integer ones.
				However, this assignment operator truncates the fractal part of non integer numbers:

				$4.2 10 assigns 10 to variable number 4.
				$4.9 10 assigns 10 to variable number 4 also.
				$~4.9 10 assigns 10 to variable number -4.

				$0+2 8 assigns 10 to variable number 0.

				$+3 1+2 8 assigns 10 to variable number (3 + 1), so variable number 4.

			v variable value

				$2 30 +v2 4 yields 34

			: change previous operator to an assignment operator

				changes the operation of the previous operator into an assignment operation that
				- uses the first operand as a variable number,
				- uses this variable's value as the first operand,
				- computes the value resulting from processing its operands,
				- assigns the resulting value to the same variable
				- and returns the assigned value :

				+:0 5 means $0 +v0 5 (Assign to variable(0) the value of variable(0) plus 5)
				~:2   means $2 ~v2   (Convert the value of variable 2 to its opposite)

				Note: the ':' operator affects the first preceding operator, if any.
				For readability, it's best to put ':' immediately after the operator it is meant to affect.

				So both expressions will yield 14 :
				$3 7 +:3 2 v3
				$3 7 +3 2: v3

				And both expressions below will negate the value of variable 20:
				~:20
				~20:

		Comparison

			= equality

				Yields 1 if both operands are equal, else 0.

				$0 5 =v0 5 yields 1

		Flow

			; two statement combinator

				Yields the value of the second statement.
				This operator is useful to supply a series of statements to operators that expect only one executable statement,
				like the ? or W(hile) operator.

				;4 30 yields 30
				;$2 10 v2 yields 10
				;;$0 4:+0 5 51 return 51 after having affected variable number 0

			? "If a, then b, else c"

				Yields operand 2 if operand 1 is not zero, else operand 3.

				?4 1 2 yields 1
				$50 0 ?v50 1 2 yields 2

			W While

				While operand 1 is non-zero, the statement in operand 2 is executed.
				If more than one statement is needed in operand 2,
				use the ; combinator operator.
				The W operator returns the value of its last executed statement.

				$0 10$1 0Wv0;:+1v0:-0 1v0
					yields the summation of 10 (10 + 9 + ... + 1)

				For readability, this can also be written as

				$0 10
				$1 0
				W
					v0
					;
						:+1 v0
						:-0 1
				v0

				Note: without the combinator operator (;),
				variable 0 wouldn't be decreased in every iteration,
				and a never-ending loop would crash the Laconic interpreter on a numeric overflow:

				$0 10
				$1 0
				W
					v0
					:+1 v0
				:-0 1
				v0

		Other

			( Operand number override

				Overrides the number of operands for the preceding operator.
				Instead of taking its default number of operands (e.g., 2 for addition),
				the operator will take all juxtaposed operands after it until the ')' operator is found.

				E.g.:

					* + 2 3 4	yields 20.
					*(+ 2 3 4) yields 9 (as the * operator didn't find a second operand, that defaults to 1).

				Note that this override operator only affects the single operator preceding immediately (bar whitespace or comments).
				If the atom before the '(' operator is a number, string or comment, the '(' operator won't have any effect.

			) End of operand number override - see '('. 

		Z Set options

			Z optionNr value

			(Normally, these options precede all other statements.)
			If the first operand refers to an unknown option,
			the operator and its operands are ignored.

			Z 0 n : maximum number of digits in a number (including decimal dot).
						 Default : no maximum. If n is negative, this default is restored.
						 If this maximum is violated by the formula, Eval throws an error.

			Z 1 n : maximum number of loops executed by F- or W-operator.
						 Default : no maximum; if n is negative, this default is restored.
						 If this maximum is violated by the formula, Eval throws an error.
						 (implemented)

			Z 2 n : Scale for BigDecimal quotients of division operator
						 (Not used for now)
						 If n is positive or zero, this is the scale of division quotients.
						 Default : 10; if n is ~1, this default is restored.
						 If n is ~2, the sum of sum of the scale
						 of the two division operands is taken as the new scale.
						 If n is ~3, the product of the scale
						 of the two division operands is taken as the new scale.

			Z 3 n : Precision "orb" for =-operator.
						 Default : 0; if n is negative, this default is restored.
